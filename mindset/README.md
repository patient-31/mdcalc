### Details a number system, probably a float-base.

 - _A to _P is 1 to 16
 - A_ to P_ id 17 to 32

 system is indexed

 P_2 = 64 the index for the qset can be found on every P_ in pattern.

 Short Int max is O_1024

 search_fast finds an integer in the set with parameter ``` ./search_fast O_1024 ``` as a string.

 search counts up to the number inputted as an integer ``` ./search 32768 ``` this takes a while if the number is large

 16column and 8column arrange the set with counted conversion to hex and octal ```./8column``` ```./16column```

 ttables shows each times_table but the result is in base 10

 ttables_2 shows a times table grid printed in md values

 factor_finder find factors of an inputted number in the main function of factor_finder.c

 This system is related to other work but is a number system, and so the copyright statements are a safeguard for other reasons, i am not a lawyer.
